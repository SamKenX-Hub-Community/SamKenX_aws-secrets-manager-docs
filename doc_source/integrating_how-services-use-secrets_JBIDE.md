The AWS Toolkit for JetBrains is an open source plugin for the integrated development environments \(IDEs\) from JetBrains\. The toolkit makes it easier for developers to develop, debug, and deploy serverless applications that use AWS\. When connecting to an Amazon Redshift cluster using the toolkit, you can authenticate using a Secrets Manager secret\.
