AWS App2Container \(A2C\) is a command line tool to help you lift and shift applications that run in your on\-premises data centers or on virtual machines, so that they run in containers that are managed by Amazon ECS, Amazon EKS, or AWS App Runner\.

App2Container uses Secrets Manager to manage the credentials for connecting your worker machine to application servers in order to run remote commands\. For more information, see [Manage secrets for AWS App2Container](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/app2container/latest/UserGuide/manage-secrets.html) in the *AWS App2Container Use Guide*\.
