# How AWS Glue Studio uses AWS Secrets Manager<a name="integrating_how-services-use-secrets_glue"></a>

AWS Glue Studio is a graphical interface that makes it easy to create, run, and monitor extract, transform, and load \(ETL\) jobs in AWS Glue\. You can use OpenSearch as a data store for your extract, transform, and load \(ETL\) jobs by configuring the Elasticsearch Spark Connector in AWS Glue Studio\. To connect to the OpenSearch cluster, you can use a secret in Secrets Manager\. For more information, see [Tutorial: Using the AWS Glue Connector for Elasticsearch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/ug/tutorial-elastisearch-connector.html) in the *AWS Glue Developer Guide*\.
