AWS IoT SiteWise is a managed service that lets you collect, model, analyze, and visualize data from industrial equipment at scale\. You can use the AWS IoT SiteWise console to create a gateway\. Then add data sources, local servers or industrial equipment that are connected to gateways\. If your source requires authentication, use a secret to authenticate\. For more information, see [Configuring data source authentication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/userguide/configure-source-authentication-ggv2.html) in the *AWS IoT SiteWise User Guide*\.
