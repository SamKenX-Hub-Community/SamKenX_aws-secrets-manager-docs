# Monitor AWS Secrets Manager secrets<a name="monitoring"></a>

AWS provides monitoring tools to watch Secrets Manager secrets, report when something is wrong, and take automatic actions when appropriate\. You can use the logs if you need to investigate any unexpected usage or change, and then you can roll back unwanted changes\. You can also set automated checks for inappropriate usage of secrets and any attempts to delete secrets\. AWS provides the following monitoring tools:
+ *AWS CloudTrail* captures API calls and related events made by or on behalf of your AWS account and delivers the log files to an Amazon S3 bucket that you specify\. For more information, see [Logging AWS Secrets Manager events with AWS CloudTrail](retrieve-ct-entries.md)\.
+ *Amazon CloudWatch* monitors your AWS resources and the applications you run on AWS in real time\. You can collect and track metrics, create customized dashboards, and set alarms that notify you or take actions when a specified metric reaches a threshold that you specify\. For more information, see the [Amazon CloudWatch User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/)\.
