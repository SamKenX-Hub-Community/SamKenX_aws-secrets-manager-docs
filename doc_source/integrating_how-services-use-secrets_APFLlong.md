Amazon AppFlow is a fully\-managed integration service that enables you to securely exchange data between software as a service \(SaaS\) applications, such as Salesforce, and AWS services, such as Amazon Simple Storage Service \(Amazon S3\) and Amazon Redshift\. 

In Amazon AppFlow, when you configure an SaaS application as a source or destination, you create a connection\. This includes information required for connecting to the SaaS applications, such as authentication tokens, user names, and passwords\. Amazon AppFlow securely stores your connection data in a Secrets Manager secret\.
