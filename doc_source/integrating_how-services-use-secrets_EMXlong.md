AWS Elemental MediaConnect is a service that makes it easy for broadcasters and other premium video providers to reliably ingest live video into the AWS Cloud and distribute it to multiple destinations inside or outside the AWS Cloud\. 

You can use static key encryption to protect your sources, outputs, and entitlements, and you store your encryption key in AWS Secrets Manager\. For more information, see [Static key encryption in AWS Elemental MediaConnect](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconnect/latest/ug/encryption-static-key.html) in the *AWS Elemental MediaConnect User Guide*\.
